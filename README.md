# My-Second-Coolest-Video-Game-Project
I am creating a video game using unity and I need to know why the file size is very large, any help would be great to reduce the file size

To see the whole code, export the code, extract all files then use the decryption key if needed to unrar, there is lot of resources in the unity game, I could not get the first character to move
, i need help making the resources work within the game.
